## How I Produced the Cleaned Data
- **Imported raw CSV**: Brought sales_transactions_raw.csv into Excel using Power Query for a repeatable process.
- **Defined column types**: Set correct data types (Date, Text, Whole Number, Decimal) to prevent calculation errors.
- **Removed duplicates**: Checked for duplicate TransactionID (or Date + TransactionID) and eliminated exact repeats.
- **Standardized text**: Trimmed spaces and unified capitalization for ProductName, Category, City, and PaymentMethod.
- **Handled missing values**: Defaulted missing Quantity to 1 or flagged rows; imputed or flagged missing UnitPrice/UnitCost.
- **Created derived fields**: Calculated Revenue, COGS, Profit, and ProfitMargin for each row.
- **Built lookup tables**: Added master tables for Products, Cities, and Customers to support consistency and enrich analysis.
- **Generated buckets**: Grouped Age into ranges (e.g., 15‚Äì29, 30‚Äì44) and created price tiers for better slicing.
- **Validated totals**: Reconciled aggregate totals (Revenue, Quantity) with the source system to confirm accuracy.
- **Exported clean file**
